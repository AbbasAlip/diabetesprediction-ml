Diabetes Prediction Using Support Vector Machine (SVM)
Welcome to the Diabetes Prediction project! This project focuses on predicting whether a person has diabetes or not based on some simple health-related features like age, the number of pregnancies (for females), body weight, glucose levels, and insulin levels in the body. We have used the Support Vector Machine (SVM) machine learning technique to build this predictive model.

Project Overview
Diabetes is a prevalent health condition that affects many individuals worldwide. Early detection and prediction of diabetes can be crucial in managing and preventing the disease's complications. This project aims to assist in identifying potential diabetes cases based on readily available data.

Getting Started
Before you begin using this project, ensure you have the necessary tools and libraries installed. You will need Python and a few Python packages like NumPy, pandas, scikit-learn, and Jupyter Notebook. You can install these packages using pip:
Data
We used a dataset containing information about various individuals, including their age, number of pregnancies, body weight, glucose levels, and insulin levels. The dataset was preprocessed to remove missing values and normalize the data for better model performance.
How it Works
Our SVM model analyzes the provided data to find patterns and relationships between the health-related features and diabetes outcomes. It then uses this knowledge to predict whether a person is likely to have diabetes or not based on the input data.


Results :- 77% ACCURACY
